--Theft of the CS50 duck took place at 10:15am 2021.7.28 at the Humphrey Street bakery.
--Interviews were conducted today with three witnesses who were present at the time – each of their interview transcripts mentions the bakery. |



--Sometime within ten minutes of the theft, I saw the thief get into a car in the bakery parking lot and drive away.
-- If you have security footage from the bakery parking lot, you might want to look for cars that left the parking lot in that time frame.

--I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized. Earlier this morning, before I arrived at Emma's bakery,
-- I was walking by the ATM on Leggett Street and saw the thief there withdrawing some money.

--As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute.
--In the call, I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow.
--The thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket.
